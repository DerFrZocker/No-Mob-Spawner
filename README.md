# No-Mob-Spawner
No-Mob-Spawner is a simple spigot plugin, with which you can remove Mob Spawner's during chunk generation

## Installation
Simple put the jar file, which you can download [here](https://github.com/DerFrZocker/No-Mob-Spawner/releases), into the plugins folder off your server.
After this, start your server. A config file should now appear in the directory `plugins/No-Mob-Spawner`. Which you can edit, to set which spawner type in which world should get removed. 
After you change the config values, save the file and restart your server.

## Note

- The plugin only removes spawner in newly generated Chunks. Not in already generated Chunks.
